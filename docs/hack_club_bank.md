# Hack Club Bank

Hi there! If you’re seeing this it’s because you’re interested in joining Hack Club during the Winter Hardware Wonderland event! Welcome and we’re so excited to have you join us in making some cool shit with friends!

In order for Hack Club to distribute the grant money to you, we’ll need to set you up with a Hack Club Bank account.

Hack Club Bank is a full stack toolkit for organizing just about anything! Under the hood, Hack Club Bank grants nonprofit status to groups or individuals who would like to raise and spend money as a nonprofit. What this means for Winter Hardware Wonderland event is that you’ll be able to receive your grant, order a debit card, and easily purchase supplies for your project. We’re using Hack Club Bank to distribute grants because of how easy it’ll be for you to spend funds on the project you’re building. Within minutes of being set up you’ll be able to receive the grant and start ordering parts!

Because you’ll be operating under Hack Club nonprofit status there are a few things that you’ll need to agree to before an account can be opened up for you.

1. You can’t use the funds for anything other than your project. If you choose to raise more money to build an even bigger project, you absolutely can! However, you’ll need to spend those funds on your project as well. You can’t buy things that aren’t related to your project.
2. You need to upload receipts for each of your transactions.
3. You (& a parent) will need to sign sign our fiscal sponsorship agreement. This is the contract that goes out that outlines the fact that you’ll be operating under Hack Club’s nonprofit status.

Does this seem like a lot of confusing information? Or are you now asking yourself - what the heck is fiscal sponsorship? Don’t worry, that’s where the next step, an onboarding call comes in.

During an onboarding call a member of the Bank operations team will chat with you about all the above. We’ll go over how to use Hack Club Bank, how to set up an account (or turn your demo account into a full account), and we’ll talk about what fiscal sponsorship means. This is a great chance for you to meet the Bank team and for us to meet you!

The call is a casual get-to-know-you call where we’ll introduce ourselves and answer any questions you might have. This is not an interview or an application. During the onboarding call we'll also need to verify the following:

- your age (you must be in high school or younger)
- country (we'll need to make sure Hack Club Bank works in your country)

There is no need to prepare anything in advance or stress out about this call. We are excited to work with you!
